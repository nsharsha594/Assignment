            <div class="description" align="justify">
                Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties
                 of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.
                It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory,
                 quantum technology, and quantum information science.
                Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, 
                and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization); 
                objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave &#8211; particle duality); and 
                there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).

            <div class="description" align="justify">
                Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field that develops methods and software tools for understanding biological data, 
                in particular when the data sets are large and complex.
                As an interdisciplinary field of science, bioinformatics combines biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, information engineering, 
                mathematics and statistics to analyze and interpret the biological data. 
                Bioinformatics has been used for in silico analyses of biological queries using computational and statistical techniques.
                Bioinformatics includes biological studies that use computer programming as part of their methodology, as well as specific analysis "pipelines" that are repeatedly used,
                particularly in the field of genomics.
                Common uses of bioinformatics include the identification of candidates genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). 
                Often, such identification is made with the aim to better understand the genetic basis of disease, unique adaptations, desirable properties (esp. in agricultural species), 
                or differences between populations. 
                In a less formal way, bioinformatics also tries to understand the organizational principles within nucleic acid and protein sequences, called proteomics.
